<h2 id=\"marketing_intro\" > INTRO: USER PERSONAS</h2>
</p>

<p>
<h3 id=\"marketing_intro\" > MARKETING PERSONAS</h3>
</p>


<p>In this project, my team was directly tasked with updating the look & feel and the content of the RailYard Home Page to better target
two Marketing Personas.<br><br>

Based on these curated Marketing Personas described by our stakeholders, my team was able to formulate two User Personas.</p>

![Marketing Personas](/img/portfolio/RailYard/Marketing_Personas.png)<br><br>

<br><br>

<p>
<h3 id=\"busowner_intro\" > SMALL BUSINESS OWNER</h3>
</p>

<p>As UX Designers, we couldn't leave out evaluating the user experience of RailYard's main product, their Dashboard.<br>

The Dashboard's primary user base is the Small Business Owner.</p><br>

<p>
<h4 id=\"sbo_interview\" > Interview with Small Business Owner</h4>
</p>
<p>
I recruited a small business owner to ask him about his recent experience working with an Internet Service Provider to set up internet for his business's new office.</p>

![Quotes from Small Business Owner Interview](/img/portfolio/RailYard/SBO_interview_graphic.png)<br><br>

<p>I also asked this small business owner: <br>
**'If you could go back in time and could have had somebody to give you helpful advice during the process ...<br> ... what would you have wanted to know?'**<br><br>
Here was what he said:</p>
![Small Business Owner Interview Conclusions](/img/portfolio/RailYard/SBO_conclusion.png)<br><br>

<p>
<h4> User Persona</h4>
</p>

<p>My team used this interview to construct a User Persona representing the **Small Business Owner**:</p><br>
![Small Business Owner User Persona](/img/portfolio/RailYard/Cassandra_User_Persona.png)<br><br>

<p>A lot of my work in this project focused on the user experience of this User Persona.</p><br><br><br><br>


<p>
<h2 id=\"as_is_assessment\" > As-Is Assessment</h2>
</p>
<p>
The RailYard Home Page held the primary avenue for reaching the RY Dashboard: an address search bar.</p><br>

![Gif Depicting Address Suggestion/Selection & Flow to the Dashboard](/img/portfolio/RailYard/600_congress.gif)<br>

<p>Since this Home Page-to-Dashboard workflow was so key to the Business Owner's experience, I wanted to evaluate its current design.<br><br>

There were two main points in this workflow experience that I thought could be greatly improved upon:<br>
1. address display inconsistency, and<br>
2. non-functioning address suggestions.</p><br>

<p>
<h3 id=\"inconsistent_addresses\" > Inconsistent Addresses from Home Page to Dashboard</h3>
</p>

<p>When the User is taken to the dashboard, the address displayed does not exactly match the address the user just selected from the dropdown on the Home Page.</p><br>

![Image Comparing Address entered in search bar to Address displayed on Dashboard](/img/portfolio/RailYard/Screenshots_comparing_addresses.png)<br><br><br>

<p>
<h3 id=\"misleading_suggestions\" > Misleading Suggestions</h3>
</p>

<p>Because not all possible addresses included in the dropdown were functional, it was possible for a user to start typing an address in the search bar, select an auto-completed address suggested to them in the dropdown list, and then attempt to hit 'Go'...</p><br>

![Gif Depicting Address Completion for 100 Metric and Selection](/img/portfolio/RailYard/100_metric.gif)<br><br>

<p>. . . and end up very confused because nothing would happen.</p><br>

<p>
<h3 id=\"busown_needs\" > Addressing Small Business Owner Needs</h3>
</p>

<p>Tying this assessment back to my findings from the interview with our Small Business Owner:<br><br>

![Small Business Owner Needs Assessed](/img/portfolio/RailYard/SBO_conclusion_2highlighted.png)<br><br>

The current design of RailYard's Dashboard addressed our Business Owner's first need: displaying ISP info in one place.<br>
I concluded after my as-is assessment that the second need could be addressed better.</p>
<br><br><br>
<br><br><br>


<p>
<h2 id=\"prototype\" > Prototype</h2>
</p>

<p>
My teammates and I mocked up wireframes and created a Prototype, focusing on the User Experience of the Small Business Owner on the RailYard Dashboard,
and in the user flow traveling to the Dashboard from the Home Page.<br><br>

We created a side panel in the RailYard Dashboard in order to address the Small Business Owner's need for guidance on deciding their business's Internet Service needs.

<p>
<h2 id=\"user_flow_diagrams\" > USER TESTING</h2>
</p><br>

<p>
<h3 id=\"user_testing_diagrams\" > USER TESTING PLAN STRATEGY</h3>
</p>

<p>I created User Flow diagrams for each User Persona and used them to devise a User Testing Plan for my team.<br><br>
To do this, I isolated points along each User Flow that depicted a testable action, and created second versions of the User Flow diagrams to bring emphasis to these actionable points.</p><br>

![Diagram depicting Cassandra's User Flow with isolated Testing Tasks](/img/portfolio/RailYard/BO_user_flow.gif)<br><br>

<p>I did this process for each User Persona: **Cassandra, Jack, and Steve**.<br>
For the sake of conciseness, here's a good look at just Cassandra's User Flow diagrams with Testing Tasks isolated:</p><br>

![Diagram depicting Cassandra's User Flow with isolated Testing Tasks](/img/portfolio/RailYard/User_Flow_BO_with_tasks.png)<br><br>

<p>We took this testing plan and strategy, and moved on to testing our prototype with users.</p><br><br><br><br>


<p>
<h3 id=\"card_sort\" > CARD SORT</h3>
</p>

<p>
I wanted to investigate user instincts surrounding the filter labels used in the Dashboard.<br><br>

To conduct these Card Sorts, I presented each participant of our user tests with a list of items that belonged to a category, and asked them what they thought the name of the category should be.</p><br>

![Card Sort graphic, no labels](/img/portfolio/RailYard/Card_Sort_Graphic_No_Labels.png)<br><br>

<p>I asked this question twice, once for each of the two different categories I wanted to investigate.</p><br>

![Card Sort graphic, with labels](/img/portfolio/RailYard/Card_Sort_Graphic.png)<br><br>

<p>The summary of the participants' feedback on the names of these categories were:<br>
**1. 'Primary Usage'** for the first category, and<br>
**2. 'Primary Need'** for the second category.
</p>

<br><br><br><br>



<h2 id=\"iteration_on_design\" > Iteration on Design</h2>



<p>
We took our findings from user testing and made changes to our design of the Dashboard.<br><br>

**Dashboard, Version 1 & 2:**</p><br>

![Gif depicting changes to Dashboard Version 1 to Version 2](/img/portfolio/RailYard/iteration_dashboard.gif)<br><br>

<p>Changes between Version 1 and 2:<br><br>

**1.** Moved guide from the side, to the top<br>
**2.** Changed the I.T. Service icon and the name to “Network Services”<br>
**3.** Created a Mbps-per-user chart<br>
**4.** Added Icons and changed the section title from 'Technology Type' to 'Internet Provider Type'<br>
**5.** Added an explanation of Upload vs. Download speed<br>
**6.** Added an explanation of Dedicated vs. Shared<br>
**7.** Moved the helpful tips to the “Know Before You Go” modal<br>
**8.** Replaced the filters on the Dashboard with summary of services available at that address; filters moved to 'Know Before You Go' modal<br><br>

**'Know Before You Go' Modal, Version 2:**</p><br>

![Graphic depicting changes to Know Before You Go modal](/img/portfolio/RailYard/iteration_on_design_kbyg.png)<br><br>

<p>Changes between Version 1 and 2:<br><br>

**1.** Moved the helpful tips from the sidebar, to the “Know Before You Go” modal<br>
**2.** Move filters from the dashboard, to the Know Before You Go modal<br>
**3.** Updated filter labels to reflect feedback from card sort exercises and client feedback</p><br>

<p>
<h3 > Trading Filters for a Form:</h3>
</p>

<p>
Our stakeholders confirmed that the user's specified requirements for the Dashboard filters - **Timeframe, Primary Usage, Reason for Shopping, & Company Size** - _should_ cause the displayed provider list to refresh ... <br>
but their back-end was not yet technically capable of accomplishing a refresh.<br><br>

We decided that collecting these pieces of information via filters on the dashboard interface without the functionality to support them, would not be a good user experience.<br><br>

So, we decided to move this information collection to a short form in the \"Know Before You Go\" modal.<br>
This way, the information could still be collected and passed along as the user traveled to the Provider's site.</p><br>

![Graphic depicting Iteration on Filter Placement](/img/portfolio/RailYard/filter_placement_iteration.png)<br><br>


<br><br><br><br><br>



<p>
<h2 id=\"user_testing_widget\" > User Testing of Widget</h2>
</p>

<p>RailYard offers a Widget integration as part of a partnership with Commercial Real Estate Listing Websites.<br><br>

RailYard's widget displays concise ISP availability data for a business address.<br><br>

This partnership is mutually beneficial because:<br>
**1.** CRE Partners are able to display ISP data in their listings, and<br>
**2.** Integration of the RailYard widget **drives traffic** to the RailYard Dashboard.<br><br>

User Flow depicting traffic coming from CRE Listing site:</p><br>

![User Flow Snippet for Widget Testing](/img/portfolio/RailYard/User_Flow_Snippet_for_widget_testing.png)<br>

<p>I wanted to investigate the UX surrounding the wording of the Widget CTA, shown as \"Visit RailYard\" above.<br><br>

I made the following mock-up of the RailYard widget to present to participants of these user tests.</p><br>

![Widget Mockup with Testing Prompts](/img/portfolio/RailYard/Widget_Mockup_with_testing_prompts.png)<br><br>

<p>Users' expectations of what would happen when they clicked the button matched what actually _does_ happen:<br>
Users are taken to the RailYard dashboard to view ISP information for the address of the office they had been viewing on the CRE Listing site.<br><br>

Users expected the label on the button to say:<br>
**1. 'See more providers on RailYard'** or **2. 'See more prices on RailYard'**</p><br>

![Widget Button Feedback Graphic](/img/portfolio/RailYard/Widget_button_feedback.png)<br><br>

<br><br><br><br><br><br>






<h2 id=\"next_steps\"> Next Steps</h2>


<p>If my team had had more time to begin a second iteration for this project, we would have performed tests to<br>
**1)** validate home page copy, and **2)** validate placement of filters on the dashbaord.</p><br>

<p>
<h3 id=\"copy_validation\"> Home Page Copy Validation</h3>
<p>

<p>
The first major component of a second iteration on this project would include a series of user tests to validate the copy we were given by our stakeholders to include in the Home Page.<br>
After isolating a group of representative users, we would ask each participant the following questions while they were actively looking at the Home Page.<br><br>

**Copy Validation Interview Questions:**<br>
**1.** Visit RailYard.com’s HomePage<br>
**2.** Scroll through the homepage. What do you think this company does?<br>
**3.** Where would you find more information on how RailYard’s offerings can benefit your business?<br>
**4.** Does the information in the “CRE/Provider” section encourage you to consider partnering with RailYard?<br>
**5.** Where would you expect to find contact information for RailYard?<br>
**6.** How would you get in touch with RailYard?<br>
**7.** Do you believe that partnering with RailYard would benefit you?<br>
**8.** Is there any information you’d like to see here, that isn’t here already?<br><br>

We would then take users' feedback during these interviews to iterate on the copy and content included in the Home Page.</p><br><br>


<p>
<h3 id=\"a/b_testing_filters\" > A/B Testing of \"Filter\" Placement</h3>
</p>

<p>The other major component of a second iteration on this project would be a series of A/B tests to investigate the effectiveness of the placement of filters on the top of the Dashboard vs. included in the 'Know Before You Go' modal.<br><br>

We would measure the number of conversions of users traveling to provider sites with each option for placement of the filters, and report back to our stakeholders which placement option proved most effective.</p>
