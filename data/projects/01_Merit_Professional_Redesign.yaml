<h3> The Company</h3>
</p>

<p>
Merit Professional is an Environmental Consulting Firm which offers various services pertaining to the prevention of water pollution at many different types of construction and manufacturing sites.<br><br>

Users arrive at the Merit Professional home page looking for information about how Merit can help their company with Storm Water Compliance, so that they won't face severe penalties, including expensive fines.<br><br>

<br><br>

<p>
<h3> The Design Challenge</h3>
</p>

<p>
**Important Factors to Consider:**<br>
**1.** Merit Professional's current website uses a **Wordpress theme**.<br>
**2.** Merit outsources their web development work.<br>
**3.** Merit has limited resources when it comes to website work.<br>
**4.** The company's logo cannot change.<br>
**5.** The current CMS theme is functional and has a fairly logical layout.<br><br>

**BUSINESS GOAL**: Adding content about Merit's Training and Certification programs to the website.<br>
Merit wants to monetize these educational services and draw more business from their Storm Water Partners.
</p>
