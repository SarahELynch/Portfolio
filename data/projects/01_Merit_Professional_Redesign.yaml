<h3> The Company</h3>
</p>

<p>
Merit Professional Services, colloquially referred to as \"Merit\", is an Environmental Consulting Firm which offers various services pertaining to the prevention of water pollution at many different types of construction and manufacturing sites.<br><br>

Users arrive at the Merit Professional home page looking for information about how Merit can help their company with Storm Water Compliance, so that they won't face severe penalties, including expensive fines.
</p><br>

<br><br>

<p>
<h3> The Design Challenge</h3>
</p>

<p>
**Important Factors to Consider:**<br>
**1.** Merit Professional's current website uses a **Wordpress theme**.<br>
**2.** Merit outsources their web development work.<br>
**3.** Merit has limited resources when it comes to website work.<br>
**4.** The company's logo cannot change.<br>
**5.** The current CMS theme is functional and has a fairly logical layout.<br><br>

**BUSINESS GOAL**: Adding content about Merit's Training and Certification programs to the website.<br>
Merit wants to monetize these educational services and use them to encourage engagement in their Partnerships.
</p><br>


<br><br><br><br><br>


<p>
<h3>Content Audit</h3>
</p><br>

<p>
I have completed an audit of all the content included in the current Merit website.<br>
Here's a look at it:

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



<p>
<h3>Content Patterns</h3>
</p>

<p>
I've created Content Patterns for the redesign of the content structure on Merit's Service Pages, Partner Pages, and the Certification & Education page.<br>

These Content Patterns are meant to illustrate the overall layout/hierarchy of the content in a particular page category.

</p>

<br>


<p>
<h4>Service Page</h4>
</p>


On the Service Pages, I wanted to:<br>
**1.** **Remove** the secondary navigation links and search bar because I felt they were redundant,<br>
**2.** **Remove** the social links because Merit Professional is not active on social media, and<br>
**3.** **Move** testimonials underneath the Service description because this section currently causes the length of the webpage to expand/contract as the length of each testimonial changes.<br><br>

Here is the content pattern for the new Service Page, compared with the current site's Service Page layout:
<br><br>

<br>





<br><br><br>

<p>
<h4>Training Page</h4>
</p>


Merit Professional wants to add content about the training, certificates, and education they provide to a page in their site.<br>
I created a Content Pattern to visualize the organization and layout of this proposed content, then turned the Content Pattern concept into a hi-fi mockup.<br><br>

Here is how the Content Pattern for the Training Page translated into a hi-fi mockup:

<p>
<h3> Visual Style Update</h3>
</p>


<p>
I wanted to alter the current **color scheme** to blend more cohesively with the Merit Logo.<br>
I also wanted to update the font pairing choices, but limit it to two major fonts: **Open Sans and Signika**.<br><br>

Here is a concise Style Guide for the typography & color update:

<br><br><br><br><br><br>



<h3> Contact Form</h3>



<p>

There are currently several different ways a customer can get in touch with Merit Professional through the website.<br>
Each one requires filling out & submitting a form, several requiring entering the same info.<br><br>

Merit Professional wants to add a way for customers to indicate their interest in Educational services.<br>
This would require yet another form!<br><br>

Below is a diagram illustrating the pieces of information required by Merit for each item a customer is interested in.<br><br>
</p>

<h4> New Contact Form Mockup</h4><br>

<p>
I have created a mockup of a new dynamic Contact Us Form that consolidates all the information collection.<br><br><br>
