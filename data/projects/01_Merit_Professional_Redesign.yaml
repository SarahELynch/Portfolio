<h3> The Company</h3>
</p>

<p>
Merit Professional Services, colloquially referred to as \"Merit\", is an Environmental Consulting Firm which offers various services pertaining to the prevention of water pollution at many different types of construction and manufacturing sites.<br><br>

Users arrive at the Merit Professional home page looking for information about how Merit can help their company with Storm Water Compliance, so that they won't face severe penalties, including expensive fines.
</p><br>

<br><br>

<p>
<h3> The Design Challenge</h3>
</p>

<p>
**Important Factors to Consider:**<br>
**1.** Merit Professional's current website uses a **Wordpress theme**.<br>
**2.** Merit outsources their web development work.<br>
**3.** Merit has limited resources when it comes to website work.<br>
**4.** The company's logo cannot change.<br>
**5.** The current CMS theme is functional and has a fairly logical layout.<br><br>

**BUSINESS GOAL**: Adding content about Merit's Training and Certification programs to the website.<br>
Merit wants to monetize these educational services and use them to encourage engagement in their Partnerships.
</p><br>


<br><br><br><br><br>


<p>
<h3>Content Audit</h3>
</p><br>

<p>
I have completed an audit of all the content included in the current Merit website.<br>
Here's a look at it:

<p>
<h3>Content Patterns</h3>
</p>

<p>
I've created Content Patterns for the redesign of the content structure on Merit's Service/Partner Page(s), and the Certification & Education page.
</p>

<br>


<p>
<h4>Service/Partner Page</h4>
</p>


Service & Partner Pages can be treated as the same Content Pattern category because the structure of the content Merit has for both is the same.<br><br>

Here is the content pattern for Service/Partner Pages:
<br><br>

![Service/Partner Page vs. new Content Pattern](/img/portfolio/Merit_Professional/Service_Partner_Page_Content_Pattern_comparison.png)

<br>


**Content Pattern Summary:**<br>
I wanted to **remove** the secondary navigation links and search bar because I felt they were redundant.<br>
I also wanted to **remove** the social links because Merit Professional is not active on social media.<br><br>
Finally, I wanted to **move** testimonials underneath the Service/Partner description because, when located in a right-hand panel, the section would cause the length of the webpage to expand/contract as the length of each testimonial changed.



<br><br><br>

<p>
<h4>Training Page</h4>
</p>


Merit Professional wants to add content about the training, certificates, and education they provide to a page in their site.<br>
I created a Content Pattern to visualize the organization and layout of this proposed content, then turned the Content Pattern concept into a hi-fi mockup.<br><br>

Here is how the Content Pattern for the Training Page translated into a hi-fi mockup:

<h3> Visual Style Update</h3>
</p>


<p>
I am currently in the process of redesigning Merit Professional Services' website visual style.<br>

Here is a **sneak peek** at the preliminary visual style update for Merit Professional's home page:
