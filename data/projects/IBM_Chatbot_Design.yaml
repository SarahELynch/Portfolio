<h1 id=\"project_intro\" > 311 BOT DESIGN PROCESS:</h1><br>
</p>

<p>
In this project, I served on a team of roughly 6 IBMers who worked to create an application meant to educate potential clients on the technology underlying the **IBM Watson Conversation Service**.

![WCS Logo](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/wcs_logo_small.png)</p>

<p>Watson Conversation Service, or \"WCS\", is the IBM Service for creating **Chatbots**.<br><br>

My team decided to design an application simulating a 311 Issue-Report Routing System.<br><br>

![Chatbot Icon](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/chatbot_icon_small.png)
The interactive element of the application would be a 311 Operator Chatbot.</p>

![Humans learn by doing textual graphic](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/humans_learn_by_doing_text.png)<br><br>

<p>**So, it made sense to create a real chatbot that users could interact with.**<br><br>

We thought an **Operator Chatbot** would be a familiar, relatable type of chat experience, leaving clients' cognitive energy available for learning about **classification**, **training**, and **dialog design**.</p><br>



<p>
<h3 id=\"def_user_bases\" > Defining our User Base(s)</h3><br>
</p>

<p>
One of the keys to our 311 Reporting Application's success was to ensure we had the correct user base in mind.<br><br>

IBM's goal in presenting these applications was to encourage the adoption of IBM's services and technologies.<br><br>

Our application's intended audience was:<br>
**Executive Representatives of large Companies.**<br><br>

So, here we have our **User Base #1**.</p><br>

![Executive Rep User Persona](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Robert_Persona.png)<br><br>


<p>However, one important catch:<br><br>

These applications were presented by IBM employees called Engagement Leaders, who walked the clients through applications and answered any & all of their questions.<br><br>

Enter, **User Base #2:**</p><br>

![Engagement Leader User Persona](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Gwen_Persona.png)<br><br>

<p>Easy, right? Two user bases.<br><br>

Well, maybe.<br>
Here's the **key** ... <br>
</p>

![User Base Key Graphic](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/user_base_key.png)<br><br>

<p>Robert, our potential Client, benefits from viewing well-designed demo applications, yes.<br>
But, he benefits even more from _truly excellent_ **presentations** of well-designed demo applications.<br><br>

So, if we enabled Gwen to present our application as well as possible, we could provide Robert with the **best** user experience.<br><br>

And, that meant that I needed to target Gwen's user experience with my chatbot design.<br>
Gwen would be the primary user of 311 Bot during her presentation of our application.</p><br><br><br>




<h2 id=\"designing_the_dialog\" > Designing the Dialog</h2>

<h3 id=\"craft_real_conv_flow\" > Crafting a Realistic Conversation Flow</h3><br>

<p>The first question to answer in designing the dialog for this 311 Operator chatbot:<br>
**How would a Human Operator handle a 311 report?**<br><br>

A human 311 operator would need to know:<br>
**1.** What issue is the caller reporting?<br>
**2.** Where is the issue happening?</p>

![Basic Human Conversation Flow Graphic](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Basic_Flow_graphic.png)<br><br>

<p>The Operator would use these two pieces of information to pass the report on to the appropriate **agency** to handle it.<br><br>

I needed to design a dialog flow to mirror the behavior of a human operator.</p><br>

![Human Operator Dialog Flow Graphic](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Human_Bot_Flow.png)<br><br><br><br>




<h3 id=\"def_user_success\" > Explicitly Defining User Success</h3><br>

<p>Chatbots converse with users based on well-defined dialog rules.<br><br>

However, Gwen doesn't have to converse this way!</p>

![Graphic of Variation on Gwen's 311 Issue Report](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Gwen_language_variation.png)<br><br>

<p>Therefore, for a conversation with the 311 Chatbot to feel natural, Gwen must have a clear understanding of **what** she should say, and **when**.<br><br>

A chatbot conversation's overall success is made up of small success along the way.<br><br>

The 311 report dialog flow based off of real Human Operator behavior helped me to determine how the conversation could be segmented.</p>

![Graphic depicting Basic Dialog Flow Segments](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Basic_Flow_graphic_checkmarks.png)<br><br>

<p>However, I knew that Gwen is used to conversing with other **humans**.<br>
Humans are really good at giving & receiving information out of order, and **interpreting it correctly anyway**.<br><br>

Gwen might:<br>
**1.** give an issue report first.<br>
**2.** give an address first.<br>
**3.** give both at the same time.</p>

![Graphic depicting Segment Order Variation](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Conversation_segments.png)<br><br>

<p>Each of these variations of Gwen's input contains a key piece of information ... <br>
Each one represents a **small success**!<br><br>

The chatbot should be flexible enough to recognize Gwen's success on each segment of the conversation, no matter what order they happen in.</p><br><br><br>





<h3 id=\"flow_diagram\" > Conversational User Flow Diagram</h3><br>

<p>Next, I had to put everything together.<br><br>

Here's the complete dialog flow that I designed for 311 Bot:</p>
![Dialog User Flow Diagram](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Chatbot_user_flow_diagram.png)<br><br>
![Dialog User Flow Location Extraction Diagram](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Chatbot_user_flow_location_extraction_diagram.png)<br><br>

<p>This flow diagram illustrates all possible paths through the conversation, including recovering from errors, misclassifications, and misinterpretations.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>




<h2 id=\"dialog_design_spec\" > Dialog Design Specification</h2><br>

<p>I created a design specification for the 311 Bot.<br><br>

This design spec was made up of a series of **test cases**, each one communicating how the bot was designed to function, given specific user input.<br><br>

Example Test Case from Design Spec:</p>
![Test Case Snippet](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Test_Case_Snippet.png)<br><br>

<p>This design spec was used to align Gwen's and our Stakeholders' expectations of bot functionality.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>



<h3 id=\"crafting_personality_voice\" > Content Strategy: Crafting Chatbot Personality & Voice</h3><br>

<p>I worked with our team's lead designer to establish the **helpful**, **neutral**, and **friendly** tone of the chatbot's personality.</p>

![Graphic depicting Sample Chatbot Responses](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Sample_Chatbot_Responses.png)

<br><br><br><br><br>





<h2 id=\"info_arch\" > Information Architecture</h2><br>


<h3 id=\"scoping_data\" > Scoping & Organizating the Training Data</h3><br>


<p>To learn how to process 311 reports, our 311 bot needed categories to use to classify user input.<br><br>

We could assume any user trying to talk with 311 Bot would want to report a 311 issue ... **You don't call 311 just to chat!**<br><br>

So, 311 Bot's categories needed to be based around the **types** of issues users could report.<br><br>

I did some research into how New York City's 311 Reporting System categorizes citizens' reports, and based 311 Bot's categories off of that.</p>

![Graphic depicting Scope of User Intent](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Intent_to_Report_graphic.png)<br><br>

<p>In our first iteration, I started 311 Bot with four categories:<br>
**1. Graffiti**<br>
**2. Street Condition**<br>
**3. Noise**<br>
**4. Damaged Tree**</p>

<br><br><br>




<h3 id=\"def_data_hierarchy\" > Defining a Hierarchicy of Training Data</h3><br>

<p>311 Bot's ultimate goal was to simulate passing a user's report onto the right **Agency** responsible for that type of issue.<br>

My research into NYC's 311 Reporting System showed that Agencies were assigned according to details in the report.<br>

I constructed training data to train 311 Bot to identify these details by **keyword**.<br><br>

I designed 311 Bot's back-end logic to use these keywords to mimic NYC's 311 Reporting System's Agency assignment.<br><br>

The organization of logic looked like this:</p>

![Intent, Entity, and Agency Mapping graphic](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Intent_Entity_Agency_Mapping.png)

<p>Once this logic was in place, 311 Bot was a fully-functioning 311 Issue Routing Operator Bot.</p>
