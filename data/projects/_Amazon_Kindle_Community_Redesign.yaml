<h3>Design Problem</h3>
</p>
<p>Kindle iOS App users are **dissatisfied** with the current \"Community\" feature.<br><br>
The Community feature is a wrapper for a pared-down version of **Goodreads**, a company bought by Amazon in 2013.<br>
It enables users to view and comment on **book reviews**.</p><br>

<p>
<h3>Design Hypothesis</h3>
</p>
![Design Hypothesis Graphic](/img/portfolio/Kindle_Community/Design_Hypothesis_v2.png)<br>
<p> Kindle App users would rather have the ability to read & participate in **discussions** on books with other readers.</p><br>

<p>
<h3>Design Solution</h3>
</p>

<p>Enable users to find, read, and participate in discussions about books, by designing a **forum-based discussion platform** to replace the current Community feature.</p>

<h2 id=\"user_research\" > User Research:</h2>
</p>

<p>I helped implement multiple types of User Research for this project, including:<br>
**1.** conducting an Online Survey <br>
**2.** conducting in-person User Interviews, and <br>
**3.** analyzing User Reviews of the GoodReads app.<br><br>

Through this research, we learned that users were dissatisfied with the review/rating functionality of GoodReads, and were disinterested in seeing book ratings made by people they didn't know.<br><br>

We also gained insight into how users behave on discussion platforms (social media, forums, etc.). <br>
We found that behavioral patterns were split:<br>
Some of our users were **active participators**. Others preferred to **observe**.</p>

<p>
<h3 id=\"SME_interview\" > Interview with Subject Matter Expert:</h3>
</p>

<p>
I recruited a user who served as my Subject Matter Expert for this project.<br>
She is an avid reader and has attended multiple bookclubs over the years. We spoke in depth about her experience discussing what she read with other readers.<br><br>

My SME described her love for hearing how stories affected other readers, and how their interpretations differed in unique and interesting ways. She lamented about how book club attendance had dwindled and how new clubs were few and far between.</p>

<p>
<h2 id=\"hand_sketches\" > Hand Sketches:</h2>
</p>

<p>
I hand-sketched a few major screens for a discussion platform concept to replace Kindle's current GoodReads Community feature.<br><br>

This discussion platform would live inside the \"Community\" tab, similar to the current GoodReads review functionality, but would instead allow users to
read and participate in discussions about books, genres, authors, etc.</p><br>

<p>
<h2 id=\"prototype\" > Prototype:</h2>
</p>

<p>
I created wireframes based on these hand-sketched ideas and built a clickable prototype.<br><br>

<h2 id=\"next_steps\" > Next Steps:</h2>



The next steps for this project are:<br><br>
**1.** recruiting users to conduct usability tests<br>
**2.** creating a usability testing plan, and<br>
**3.** conducting usability tests & documenting findings.
