<h3> Immersive Experience Overview</h3>
</p>

<p>
Immersive Experiences are demo applications presented to potential clients in Client Experience Centers.<br>
The applications are shown on a large wall of screens, along with additional displays, such as touch tables.<br>
The presentations of Immersive Experiences are led by IBM employees called Engagement Leaders.<br><br>

<h3> Our 311-Reporting Immersive Experience</h3>
</p>

<h4 id=\"Design_Problem\" > Design Problem</h4>
<p>Design & Implement an **immersive experience** to educate clients on Watson Conversation Service.</p>

<h4 id=\"Design_Hypothesis\" > Design Hypothesis</h4>
<p>Clients will learn more easily if they can interact with an example WCS Chatbot.</p>

<h4 id=\"Design_Solution\" > Design Solution</h4>
<p>Create an **immersive experience** simulating a 311 Issue Reporting System, using a 311 Operator Chatbot.</p>


Our Immersive 311 Reporting Application was made up of two parts:<br>
1. Visualizations displayed on the wall of screens, triggered by user interactions with ... <br>
2. the **311 Operator Chatbot**, on the touch table.
</p><br>




<h4 id=\"def_user_bases\" > Defining our User Bases</h4><br>

<p>Our Engagement Leader, **Gwen**, was the primary user of our app's **Chatbot**.</p><br>

<h3>My Linguistic Design Challenge</h3><br>

<p>
My design challenge was to make a chatbot that:<br>
**1.** interpreted and routed 311 reports while providing a good user experience, and<br>
**2.** highlighted Watson Conversation Service capabilities.<br><br>

This was essentially a **Linguistic Design Challenge**. Read further to learn about my 311 Chatbot design process!

<h2 id=\"designing_the_dialog\" > Designing the Dialog</h2>

<br>

<h3 id=\"craft_real_conv_flow\" > Crafting a Realistic Conversation Flow</h3><br>

<p>The first question to answer in designing the dialog for this 311 Operator chatbot:<br>
**How would a Human Operator handle a 311 report?**<br><br>

A human 311 operator would need to know:<br>
**1.** What issue is the caller reporting?<br>
**2.** Where is the issue happening?</p>

![Basic Human Conversation Flow Graphic](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Basic_Flow_graphic.png)<br><br>

<p>The Operator would use these two pieces of information to pass the report on to the appropriate **agency** to handle it.<br>

I needed to design a dialog flow to mirror the behavior of a human operator.</p><br>

![Human Operator Dialog Flow Graphic](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Human_Bot_Flow.png)<br><br><br><br>


<br><br>


<h3 id=\"segmenting_dialog\" > Segmenting the Dialog</h3><br>

<p>
The 311 report dialog flow based off of real Human Operator behavior helped me to determine how the conversation could be segmented: by issue collection, and address collection.<br><br>
However, I knew that Gwen is used to **conversing flexibly**.<br>

Gwen might:<br>
**1.** give an issue report first.<br>
**2.** give an address first.<br>
**3.** give both at the same time.</p>

![Graphic depicting Segment Order Variation](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Conversation_segments.png)<br><br>

<p>The chatbot needed to be flexible enough to recognize each segment of the conversation, no matter the order.</p><br><br><br>


<br><br>


<h3 id=\"scoping_data\" > Scoping & Organizing the Training Data</h3><br>

<p>
To learn how to process 311 reports, our 311 bot needed categories to use to classify user input.<br>

I roughly based 311 Bot's categories off of how New York City's 311 Reporting System categorizes citizens' reports.</p>

<a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/311/\" target=\"_blank\">See NYC's categories here.</a><br><br>

![Graphic depicting Scope of User Intent](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Intent_to_Report_graphic.png)


<br><br><br><br>




<h3 id=\"def_data_hierarchy\" > Defining a Hierarchicy of Training Data</h3><br>

<p>My research into NYC's 311 Reporting System showed that Agencies were assigned according to details in a report.<br>

I constructed training data to train 311 Bot to identify these details by **keyword**.<br><br>

I designed 311 Bot's back-end logic to use these keywords to mimic NYC's 311 Reporting System's Agency assignment.</p><br>

![Intent, Entity, and Agency Mapping graphic](/img/portfolio/311_Chatbot/Intent_Entity_Agency_Mapping.png)



<br><br><br><br>



<h3 id=\"memorable_exp\" > Creating a Memorable Experience</h3><br>

<p>
I also used this keyword framework to create a good chat user experience.<br>
By carefully crafting variations of these keywords (training data), I created a 311 Bot that was able to occasionally surprise users when it recognized words within their utterances.

<h3 id=\"flow_diagram\" > Conversational User Flow Diagram</h3><br>

<p>Next, I had to put everything together.<br><br>

Here's the complete dialog flow that I designed for 311 Bot:</p>

<p>This flow diagram illustrates all possible paths through the conversation, including recovering from errors, misclassifications, and misinterpretations.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>




<h2 id=\"dialog_design_spec\" > Dialog Design Specification</h2><br>

<p>I created a design specification for the 311 Bot.<br><br>

This design spec was made up of a series of **test cases**, each one communicating how the bot was designed to function, given specific user input. It was used to align Gwen's and our Stakeholders' expectations of bot functionality.<br><br>

**Happy Path** Test Case from Design Spec:</p>
